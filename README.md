## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js: [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- npm: npm is bundled with Node.js, so if you have Node.js installed, you should also have npm.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SOUMOJIT-CHAKRABORTY/Major-Project.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Major-Project
```

3. Install the backend dependencies:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

4. Navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
cd frontend
```

5. Install the frontend dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Starting the Development Servers

1. Start the backend server (from the root directory):

```bash
npm start
```

2. Start the frontend development server (from the `frontend` directory):

```bash
npm run dev
```

The backend server will be running at `http://localhost:3000`, and the frontend development server will be running at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Project Structure

Explain the organization of your project's folders and files here. For example:

- `backend/`: Contains the backend server code.
- `frontend/`: Contains the frontend code built with Vite.
- `public/`: Public assets used in the frontend.
